Buyer sent check ( was told it was a cashiers check ) directly to Chase bank. Check was rec 'd at Chase on XX/XX/20. I contacted Chase on XX/XX/20 and was told loan was paid in full. I specifically asked if it was okay in releasing vehicle to buyer. I was told yes, it was a recorded line so this should be verifiable. I was told it would take approximately 10 days for the additional funds to reach me. On XX/XX/20 buyer provided sent me a proof of insurance on vehicle and arranged for a local towing company to pick up the vehicle. On XX/XX/20 I reached out to Chase Bank again on status of check that was to come to me and was told the check had been mailed out. On XX/XX/20 Chase mailed me the vehicle lien release. On XX/XX/20 after still not receiving the check I reached out to Chase who advised the check mailed to me certified check and been intercepted because the buyers check had a stop payment placed on it on XX/XX/20 and therefore the loan was reinstated. At this point the truck is no longer in my position and Chase has been completely unwilling to help and continue to state my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX. I've spoke with their fraud department who said it was a said situation, but there was nothing they could do. I've asked Chase for a copy of the check and they said they would mail it to me, but haven't gotten it. I do not understand how Chase can accept a check on XX/XX/20 and it allowed to be stopped XX/XX/20. Of course the buyer 's number is no longer in service, the police has went to the location that the truck was delivered and it isn't there, the address the buyer gave it to an office building. I felt having the check mailed directly to Chase and waiting for them to advise us when it was safe to release possession of the truck was being extra cautious and they are blaming us for the issue and told us just to turn it in to our insurance.

              "11956  Sold vehicle I had financed with Chase Bank. I owed {$25000.00} and sold vehicle for {$30000.00}. Buyer sent check ( was told it was a cashiers check ) directly to Chase bank. Check was rec 'd at Chase on XX/XX/20. I contacted Chase on XX/XX/20 and was told loan was paid in full. I specifically asked if it was okay in releasing vehicle to buyer. I was told yes, it was a recorded line so this should be verifiable. I was told it would take approximately 10 days for the additional funds to reach me. On XX/XX/20 buyer provided sent me a proof of insurance on vehicle and arranged for a local towing company to pick up the vehicle. On XX/XX/20 I reached out to Chase Bank again on status of check that was to come to me and was told the check had been mailed out. On XX/XX/20 Chase mailed me the vehicle lien release. On XX/XX/20 after still not receiving the check I reached out to Chase who advised the check mailed to me certified check and been intercepted because the buyers check had a stop payment placed on it on XX/XX/20 and therefore the loan was reinstated. At this point the truck is no longer in my position and Chase has been completely unwilling to help and continue to state my next payment is due on XX/XX/XXXX. I've spoke with their fraud department who said it was a said situation, but there was nothing they could do. I've asked Chase for a copy of the check and they said they would mail it to me, but haven't gotten it. I do not understand how Chase can accept a check on XX/XX/20 and it allowed to be stopped XX/XX/20. Of course the buyer 's number is no longer in service, the police has went to the location that the truck was delivered and it isn't there, the address the buyer gave it to an office building. I felt having the check mailed directly to Chase and waiting for them to advise us when it was safe to release possession of the truck was being extra cautious and they are blaming us for the issue and told us just to turn it in to our insurance. This will cause our rates to go up and be possibly dropped.  ...  vehicle vehicle buyer check cashier bank check chase chase loan vehicle line day fund buyer proof insurance vehicle company vehicle status check check chase vehicle lien check check check buyer stop payment loan point truck position chase payment fraud department situation chase copy check chase check buyer number service police location truck address buyer office building check possession truck issue insurance rate\n",

I also had purchases on the card. I have made payments in the amount of {$3600.00} since the balance transfer was processed. Chase has been applying the minimum payment ONLY to the purchases at 24.49 % APR and then applying the remaining payment to the balance transfer at 0 %! The statement reads under how to avoid paying interest on purchases, \" Because we apply payments in excess of your minimum payment first to HIGHER rate balances, you may not be able to avoid interest charges on new purchases if you have another balance at higher interest rates unless you pay your balance in full each month. '' Therefore they should be applying these large payments to the purchases at 24.49 % APR, however they are applying to my 0 % balance transfer. I have contacted them 5 times since XX/XX/XXXX as I have been charged interest on purchases made. Their response is that \" If you pay your minimum payment, it will be generally allocated : - First towards any flexible financing offer balances with special payment obligations which require repayment of the balance over a pre-selected number of billing periods. \\n\\n- Then to balances with the lowest APR - Then to balances with the highest APR This is contrary to what the statement reads and predatory lending in my opinion.

I found this out as I was checking the balance of a credit card we have had for years with Chase (   XXXX   Visa ) - a nd all of a sudden, there were  XXXX  accounts instead of just  XXXX . We had never applied for this card and called  XXXX  immediatel y. Someone had fraudulently opened the Amazon Chase Visa card in our name on the exact same  da y (   XXXX   XXXX    ). Chase cancelled the card.\\n<P/>\\nChase was helpful in cancelling the card, but when asked if they would contact the credit bureaus, we were told that was our problem. They opened a card without any information other than an old address ( from more than three years ago ) and an obviously fake email address, but we now have to fix the problem?    <P/> In addition, based on internet research, this appears to potentially be a  n inside job either by Amazon or Chase.\\n<P/>  I have put fraud alerts on both my husband 's and my credit reports with all the credit bureaus.  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   husband s mine account balance credit card year  account  card card name  card  card credit bureaus problem card information address year email address problem p addition internet research job fraud alert husband s credit report credit bureaus\n",

              "3141   I processed a balance transfer to my Chase Amazon card in the amount of {$3900.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The balance transfer was offered at 0 % until XXXX of XXXX. I also had purchases on the card. I have made payments in the amount of {$3600.00} since the balance transfer was processed. Chase has been applying the minimum payment ONLY to the purchases at 24.49 % APR and then applying the remaining payment to the balance transfer at 0 %! The statement reads under how to avoid paying interest on purchases, \" Because we apply payments in excess of your minimum payment first to HIGHER rate balances, you may not be able to avoid interest charges on new purchases if you have another balance at higher interest rates unless you pay your balance in full each month. '' Therefore they should be applying these large payments to the purchases at 24.49 % APR, however they are applying to my 0 % balance transfer. I have contacted them 5 times since XX/XX/XXXX as I have been charged interest on purchases made. Their response is that \" If you pay your minimum payment, it will be generally allocated : - First towards any flexible financing offer balances with special payment obligations which require repayment of the balance over a pre-selected number of billing periods. \\n\\n- Then to balances with the lowest APR - Then to balances with the highest APR This is contrary to what the statement reads and predatory lending in my opinion. I have requested several times that they adjust my bill to process the payments made to the higher interest purchase balance but they just keep responding with the above statement. I can not pay the full balance or I would have never completed the balance transfer in the first place!  ...  balance transfer  card amount  balance transfer  purchase card payment amount balance transfer  payment purchase payment balance transfer statement interest purchase payment excess payment rate balance interest charge purchase balance interest rate balance month payment purchase balance transfer time interest purchase response minimum payment financing offer balance payment obligation repayment balance number billing period balance balance statement predatory lending opinion time bill payment interest purchase balance statement balance balance transfer place\n",

My interest rate of 10 % is a predatory loan which I have tried unsuccessfully to modify twice with Chase to no avail and can not qualify for HARP because my loan is not with XXXX. Chase continues to add unwarranted fees such as having someone come by my house, which I 've been in for eight years now, to make sure \" my family still lives there ''. I was just put in collection in XX/XX/XXXX while not being late on my payment. When asked why, I was told because my payment was late. Clearly it was not. They waived the late charge but I 'm not sure they will report this correctly to the credit bureau. I need help getting rid of this loan and refinancing to a market rate loan. Please help.  ...                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   mortgage interest rate predatory loan  avail harp loan fee house year family collection  payment payment charge credit bureau loan market rate loan\n",

However, they continue to charge consumers fees during this time period. \\n\\nThis makes no sense as it's not to protect the consumer. No consumer is in danger of a rogue deposit, especially one they initiated. This is for Chase 's benefit, and Chase 's alone.

Chase will not even tell me what caused it, referring to these matters as \" confidential '' ( even though they involve a deposit from one of my accounts into another ). As such, is impossible for a consumer to prevent this from happening. \\n\\nConsumers are left in a state where their only choice is to constantly be carrying a significant extra balance in their accounts, as any deposit could be frozen at any time.

I sold a home and the proceeds were wired into my Attorney Trust Account on XX/XX/18. Once the wire posted, I wrote a check from my attorney trust account to myself and went to my local Chase branch to deposit it into my personal account. The teller told me it would be a 2 day hold. I said \" Fine '' and deposited the check. On the day the hold was to be released, I get an email from Chase saying that they were going to hold it an additional 8 days. I went to the Chase branch who then had to call me back once the manager returned. Manager said she could not do anything. I asked to give me the check back, but they said that they could not do that. They escalated the problem to their corporate help line, but they said that they would not clear it nor give me my check back. The only reason for the hold was that the check amount was large. As a lawyer, if I bounce an trust account check, I would lose my law license and go to jail. \\nI have completed thousands of real estate closings and never had a proceeds check held for a week and a half. If that was to be the case, I would have wired the money. I believe that they are only holding the check to take advantage of using the interest free money for 10 days.  ...     0\n",
              "4265   On XX/XX/XXXX, I initiated a {$4000.00} deposit to Chase to pay my bills. Chase decided to put that \" on hold '' until XX/XX/XXXX, nearly 2 full weeks later. I called XXXX ( the sourcing institution ), and they said the transaction had \" completely cleared '' by XX/XX/2010 full days before Chase will release my money. \\n\\nChase has already charged me multiple {$34.00} fees, sometimes on the same transaction. I also was charged returned check fees from the bills that were supposed to be paid successfully. \\n\\nI've reached out to the company 3 times now asking for a way to resolve this, so that I am not racking up more and more fees, and they have not given me any path to resolution. Their only suggestion has been to set up a Chase savings account and throw even more money at them ( even though they *already* have {$4000.00} of my money that I can no longer get to, and have no reassurance that any other deposits will not likewise be frozen ). \\n\\nChase currently can freeze transactions if they think they might be at risk of losing money due to fraud. However, they continue to charge consumers fees during this time period. \\n\\nThis makes no sense as it's not to protect the consumer. No consumer is in danger of a rogue deposit, especially one they initiated. This is for Chase 's benefit, and Chase 's alone. Chase is charging the consumer for processes that they *choose* to perform to reduce their own risk costs. \\n\\nEven worse, this process is completely opaque to the consumer. Chase will not even tell me what caused it, referring to these matters as \" confidential '' ( even though they involve a deposit from one of my accounts into another ). As such, is impossible for a consumer to prevent this from happening. \\n\\nConsumers are left in a state where their only choice is to constantly be carrying a significant extra balance in their accounts, as any deposit could be frozen at any time. I'm sure Chase loves this side effect ( as they reiterated several times how this was necessary to prevent it ), but that should not be a requirement for consumers to bank with them.  ...     0\n",

In order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our Consumer Online Technical Support Team. '' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer.

I ended the call and called chase again. \\n\\nWhen I called chase the second time, the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information.

Morgan Chase restricted my account by my debit card Tuesday XX/XX/2019. On Thursday XX/XX/2019 I went into A branch after being advised by a customer service representative that my account would actually be closed. I went into the branch to see how I can remove the funds that are in there currently in as well as if my direct deposit from my place of employment would be returned. The bank associate and the customer service representative assured me that the funds would Post but they may take an additional business day. That Saturday I attempted to go inside of a branch yet again to retrieve my funds that actually did post on Friday, XX/XX/2019. Upon looking at my account I realize that the funds have been reversed and no longer were present on my current statement. Ive been called and I was told that it may take two business day stating Tuesday, XX/XX/XXXX would be the date that my funds would be available to withdraw from a bank teller only. Now, Chase is informing me that I will be mailed a check into the three business days to recover the funds that are owed to me and left in my account currently. Unfortunately, This has put me in an additional financial bind do two fees from late rent late car payments, etc. I am not being a short or giving written notice that these things will actually occur so that I have peace of mind in fact Chase has handled my situation grossly I even had a bank teller inform me that my account looks suspicious after giving me a suspicious look myself. Although I know that Chase reserves the right to close my account at any time I do believe that their protocol has been in the past to give notice in the form of a written document.

I called to follow up on XX/XX/XXXX about the terms and was told everything was on the account and once I made XXXX direct deposit the bonus would be paid out in 10 days. As of XXXX I had made the required deposits and was told my account never had the coupon code applied and it was past the 21 days to do so, so no bonus would be paid.  ...     0\n",

They opened a ticket, got escalated to their tech team, but when I would call back to find out what happened, they told me that the case had been closed. This happened 3 times, and each call has taken a lot of time to explain the situation and verify a bunch of information. \\n\\nGoing from ultimaterewards.com and chase.com have the  same result. \\n\\nI'm not able to use these points by phone either, because the operators for the Travel Center are not able to access my account/points neither. \\n\\nI've tried every browser, both XXXX and XXXX computers, and the XXXX Chase phone application. They all send me to the page that says \" We are unable to complete your request at this time '' On XX/XX/XXXX, I looked up some people that work in Ultimate Rewards on XXXX, and cold called a VP of Customer Relations. He acted like he was helpful at first, and we exchanged some emails. He eventually said I can buy a flight/hotel using Chase Sapphire and if I give him the details, he will deduct the appropriate points and credit my credit card for the purchase. \\n\\nLong story short, he wasn't able to fix anything. \\n\\nI can see that I'm still collecting points, but I haven't been able to access it. \\n\\nI travel a lot, and it's become a huge inconvenience that I'm not able to access these points which I intended to use for travel. I need to get this issue resolved ASAP.  ...     1\n",

I contacted chase around noon today XX/XX/2019 and was asked the last 4 numbers of my chase savings account and the other user on my account. I responded that I did not have a savings and I am only authorized user. Customer rep told me they would call me back in 10 minutes to keep the line open. I didnt receive a call back after an hour so I contacted chase. From the first call I thought someone was using my card fraudulently. I spoke to the rep who transferred me to a supervisor XXXX who said the card was activated and the transaction would process. Called the catering company and card was declined. I then used my XXXX  XXXX card to pay for the order. XXXX XXXX texted me asking if I was authorizing purchase and I responded yes. Contacted caterer and XXXX  XXXX was declined. I contacted chase again spoke to rep was told the initial questions are used to trick people to see what there answer would be. She told me the CVV code was incorrectly being input by the caterer and I responded that I had gone over the numbers and CVV used was correct. She told me the card was cleared for the purchase and she would monitor it for 24 hours. Called caterer - card declined. Use a MasterCard  which processed. Went to use chase amazon at restaurant at XXXX pm tonight in the amount of {$63.00} - it was declined. I was told by chase I was not over limit. Still frustrated figuring out multiple declines after several conversations with chase stating the card would be ok to use. Embarrassed as the caterer kept suggesting I was over my limit which I pay my card in full every month and chase confirmed that I was under my limit with the {$710.00} transaction. Never been declined by either chase or XXXX  XXXX before - today after multiple assurances that I was all set and card would be monitored to make sure transaction would clear - it never did  ...     1\n",

Therefore, I request a one month payment extension with my Auto Loan Company, Chase. For the past almost fours years, my request for payment extension is granted. I have never been delinquent with my auto loan payment. However, On XX/XX/2019 my request for a one month payment extension was denied this year. I explained my situation to representative and the supervisor with no avail. After a lengthy discussion and waiting, I was informed the reason for the decline as it is not \" contractual ''. This reason for denial baffled me and therefore I emailed the office of XXXX XXXX Executive Director, Communications, JPMorgan Chase & Co. A representative contacted me and stated Chase will follow-up. About week later a representative of XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX office called. The representative shared her role was help resolve the matter. The representative via conference call contacted the department handing my request. After, reviewing my information my request was still denied based on \" policy changes ''.

I made payments of {$160.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and {$260.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. The minimum payment was {$140.00}. The closing date was XX/XX/XXXX ( please see attached statement ). That statement ( XX/XX/XXXX ) shows that I had an outstanding purchase balance of {$230.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. I have enclosed the previous months statement to show that there were NO other purchases prior to the one on XX/XX/XXXX. \\nHowever, when I got the XXXX statement, it shows that I still have a purchase balance of {$210.00}. I have a promotional balance (@XXXX ) in XXXX of {$6900.00}. In XXXX, the promotional balance was {$7200.00} - a difference of {$380.00}. \\n\\nApparently, the payment ( above the minimum payment required by Chase ) I thought would be applied to the purchase (@ 21.49 % ) was applied to the promotional balance first. It is my understanding that once the minimum payment has been met, payments in excess of the minimum would be applied to the highest interest rate balance first. This is not the first time that Chase has skirted US Financial Law to turn a larger profit. I need help in rectifying this problem, because my logic fell on deaf ears at Chase.

I put in my information for the offer and within less than a minute, was notified via the screen that a decision could not be made. I immediately contacted XXXX and was referred to Chase Bank. I then immediately contacted Chase bank within no more than 10minutes of getting the notification on the screen and I was told by the Chase representative I spoke with that my application was denied but she could not state why. I asked for more information about the XXXX  offer and she explained that even if I had been approved, the credit offer only gets applied after the first account statement and could not be used to purchase the ticket. I then explicitly told her I was glad I got denied and I was ABSOLUTELY no longer interested in the account. I asked that the application be withdrawn and the representative obliged. This all happened no later than 10mins after putting in the application on XX/XX/2018. Notwithstanding my explicit request not to proceed with the application and contrary to what I was told by the Chase representative, Chase did in fact go ahead to open a credit account in my name on XX/XX/2018. This is now being reported in my Credit Report and Chase has refused to correct this information on my credit report even though they went ahead to process an application which I did not consent to and out of their error.  ...     3\n",

I have made several attempts to get chase bank to contact the bureau and remove this inquiry that was not authorized by me. They seem to not be able to get me to the right person to take care of this issue no matter how many attempts I have made nobody seems to understand what I'm talkin about. I want chase bank to have this fraudulent inquiry removed from my credit report before I take legal action. I I have never requested any kind of credit with chase bank or hold any account with them. I have an iquiry from XX/XX/2019. I want this matter resolved.  ...     3\n",

I was charged twice for this transaction. I placed a disputes case with Chase bank on XX/XX/2019 when I noticed the charge on my account. I called back on Sunday, XX/XX/2019 about the provisional credit for the charge and again on Monday, XX/XX/2019. I was told the charge had to post before a provisional credit could be provided. I used my debt card on Monday, XX/XX/2019 then tried to use it again but it would not work. I went to Chase bank on XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX, Nevada and was told that my account was closed due to fraudulent activity. I was shocked because I had not reported fraud on my account. I later found out that I was being accused by the disputes department of placing a fraudulent disputes case for the duplicate charge from XXXX XXXX  XXXX. I later contacted XXXX XXXX  XXXX again and was told that they DID see a duplicate charge and would credit my account within 3 - 5  days. I contacted the chase disputes department again on Monday, XX/XX/XXXX. 2019 and explained thaXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX would credit my account and that I did not like being accused of making a fraudulent disputes claim. The escalation manager did NOT care and told me that Chase decision on closing my account was final. I had been a customer of Chase for XXXX   years. My character has been challenged by the disputes agents and I consider this to be detrimental to my character and slander. \\n\\nI am NOT seeking to keep my account open with Chase BUT I also do NOT want Chase reporting that they closed my checking account involuntarily. \\n\\nOnce again, I do NOT want Chase to have the checking account that I had with them being reflecting on any public records as being closed as involuntary closure by Chase. \\n\\nI did nothing wrong by filing a disputes claim for the duplicate charge or any other disputes cases that were filed in the past.  ...     4\n",
              "8   On XXXX XX/XX/2019, I made a {$300.00} payment to an online retailer using Chase quick pay with XXXX on the Chase website. I realized that this was a scam website after no confirmation, product, or response to any inquiries regarding the order and contacted Chase to get more information about the transaction to attempt getting a refund through the retailers bank. \\n\\nI contacted Chase via a secured message on XX/XX/2019 explaining what happened and asked \" Is there a way to reverse this transaction, or do you have a contact at XXXX that can give me more information about the recipient? '' That XXXX, my message was reviewed and I received a response restating my original email and informing me that \" The transfer has been completed. However, as you mentioned that the website is a scam while we can handle most inquiries by email, some require the expertise of another team. In order to assist you better in regards to the refund we request you to call our Consumer Online Technical Support Team. '' I called the number listed in the email and explained my situation to then be transferred to the claims department. I was directed to call XXXX and ask them about the transaction because Chase did not have any information outside of what I provided when initiating the transfer. I felt like this agent was trying to get me to end the call as quickly as possible and I had to interrupt her closing script to ask for a contact number at XXXX and didn't have an opportunity to get any information about what the right questions would be to ask XXXX or what words and phrases I should use to get the information I was looking for. \\n\\nI called XXXX who's automated system initially directed me to call my bank because I used the banks app to initiate the transaction. I called XXXX again to navigate their menus and talk to a customer service agent. They told me that all of the information about the transaction would in Chase 's system because I used the banks app to perform the transaction. She stayed on the line with me until I understood everything that I should ask and had a better understanding of the situation. I ended the call and called chase again. \\n\\nWhen I called chase the second time, the agent tried to look up the information about the receiving bank but could not find any additional information. She then asked me why I needed this information and I explained my situation again. I was once again transferred to the claims department, who told me that I needed to contact XXXX to get the information I was looking for. After I told her that I had already contacted them, she finally admitted that there was nothing that she could do due to the nature of the transaction and that these types of transactions are not secured. She said that Chase had no information about the recipient other than the email address that I inputted and that the recipients banking information was not kept in the system. In both phone calls, they asked if I initiated that transaction, and used that to absolve themselves of all responsibility in regards to this matter. \\n\\nDuring this whole process, it felt like Chase was not transparent about their policies regarding these types of transactions nor were they helpful in helping me get any information about the situation. These transactions are advertised as a \" fast, safe and easy way to send money, '' but seem to be a dangerous way to do business. I feel deceived by Chase 's advertising and further victimized by the way I was treated by the members on their customer service team.  ...     4\n",

              "      <td>On XX/XX/XXXX, I won and paid for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' laptop on XXXX. I paid using my Chase credit card in two transactions {$1400.00} ( for the item ) plus an additional {$120.00} ( for the tax ). I picked up the XXXX, foolishly trusted the seller and took the XXXX home. I went to turn the XXXX on the following day ( XX/XX/XXXX ), it would not turn on. I contacted the seller via ebay as well as their email address ( on their business card ) on XX/XX/XXXX because I allowed the XXXX to charge overnight. No reply. I again contacted them on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and no reply. I contacted Chase. They advised they would open the dispute ( 2 ). XX/XX/XXXX Chase sent a noticed telling me the merchant said they spoke to me and I made a mistake opening the dispute, that was a lie. The noticed said \" If you want to continue with the dispute, sign and return and we'll go forward '' ( in short ). I sent a secure message thru the app noting that Id like to continue with the dispute. XX/XX/XXXX I received notice from Chase stating they are considering the charge for {$1400.00} valid. I called the specialist on the claim and he stated he had no received information he requested of me. I advised him I sent all info in. He asked that I re-open the claim and fax the information I have to a fax number. I did that right away and was given a new claim number. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice that they approved my claim for {$120.00} ( the 2nd charge ), and credited my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice they denied my claim for {$1400.00} and that charge is valid. I called XXXX, the specialist to discuss and he advised they never received the faxes. I have proof the faxes were successfully uploaded. I begged him to look for them. He said he will have someone call me back. I have no faith. I am getting the run around and it is not fair. I am stuck with a broken {$1500.00} computer and Chase will not help me. Please, I have all paperwork and proof of everything. Please help me get my {$1400.00} back. \\nThese are the dates I have spoke to XXXX the claims XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ( 2 times ), XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and a few more. \\nThese are the dates I have attempted to reach out to the merchant before opening the any dispute : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ... .all had no reply to them. \\nPlease take note, when I opened the claim, it has 2 disputes because the computer was paid in 2 separate charges. Why would they approve one charge and not the MAIN one?</td>\n",

I received several alerts in my email showing me the inquiries and what companies. I am unaware of the inquiries and I am now working with an investigator to assure nothing more occurred during the inquiries that would cause me and my credit more problems. Seems like this has happened in the past due to a credit breach and fraud. I dont know if this was a mistake or an error this is very frustrating for me and I am in distress because Im not sure of where these inquiries came from but my job is to make sure that this wasnt an inside job with your company, and the credit bureaus. I am leaning towards taking legal actions on your company, the credit bureaus and whoever is involved with this matter. I have contacted the FTC, the attorney general office located in XXXX XXXX also be aware that you will receive legal documents pertaining this matter soon. I have attached a letter to the file, please read the letter. I am in the process of getting ready to purchase a home by the end of this month and I am XXXX something like this occurred at this time.

              "8345   On XX/XX/XXXX, I won and paid for a XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX '' laptop on XXXX. I paid using my Chase credit card in two transactions {$1400.00} ( for the item ) plus an additional {$120.00} ( for the tax ). I picked up the XXXX, foolishly trusted the seller and took the XXXX home. I went to turn the XXXX on the following day ( XX/XX/XXXX ), it would not turn on. I contacted the seller via ebay as well as their email address ( on their business card ) on XX/XX/XXXX because I allowed the XXXX to charge overnight. No reply. I again contacted them on XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX and no reply. I contacted Chase. They advised they would open the dispute ( 2 ). XX/XX/XXXX Chase sent a noticed telling me the merchant said they spoke to me and I made a mistake opening the dispute, that was a lie. The noticed said \" If you want to continue with the dispute, sign and return and we'll go forward '' ( in short ). I sent a secure message thru the app noting that Id like to continue with the dispute. XX/XX/XXXX I received notice from Chase stating they are considering the charge for {$1400.00} valid. I called the specialist on the claim and he stated he had no received information he requested of me. I advised him I sent all info in. He asked that I re-open the claim and fax the information I have to a fax number. I did that right away and was given a new claim number. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice that they approved my claim for {$120.00} ( the 2nd charge ), and credited my account. On XX/XX/XXXX, I received notice they denied my claim for {$1400.00} and that charge is valid. I called XXXX, the specialist to discuss and he advised they never received the faxes. I have proof the faxes were successfully uploaded. I begged him to look for them. He said he will have someone call me back. I have no faith. I am getting the run around and it is not fair. I am stuck with a broken {$1500.00} computer and Chase will not help me. Please, I have all paperwork and proof of everything. Please help me get my {$1400.00} back. \\nThese are the dates I have spoke to XXXX the claims XXXX : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ( 2 times ), XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, and a few more. \\nThese are the dates I have attempted to reach out to the merchant before opening the any dispute : XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX, XX/XX/XXXX ... .all had no reply to them. \\nPlease take note, when I opened the claim, it has 2 disputes because the computer was paid in 2 separate charges. Why would they approve one charge and not the MAIN one?  ...   Theft/Dispute Reporting\n",

I received several alerts in my email showing me the inquiries and what companies. I am unaware of the inquiries and I am now working with an investigator to assure nothing more occurred during the inquiries that would cause me and my credit more problems. Seems like this has happened in the past due to a credit breach and fraud. I dont know if this was a mistake or an error this is very frustrating for me and I am in distress because Im not sure of where these inquiries came from but my job is to make sure that this wasnt an inside job with your company, and the credit bureaus. I am leaning towards taking legal actions on your company, the credit bureaus and whoever is involved with this matter. I have contacted the FTC, the attorney general office located in XXXX XXXX also be aware that you will receive legal documents pertaining this matter soon.

I used the card for a month or so and next thing I know after I logged in to my online banking that my account was closed. It is completely understandable that each party can close the account at its discretion but reasonably. I called the customer service to find out why the only answer was that I would get an explanation letter in the mail. I did eventually get a letter that explained that the account was closed to to previous unsatisfactory relationship. I called again to figure out what was unsatisfactory about my overall relationship but never got a response. I am under impression that my race ( I am of XXXX descent ) played a role in their decision making as I have never had unsatisfactory relationship with Chase. If I had unsatisfactory relationship my account would have not been approved in the first place. I tried looking for some answers by googling and searching on forums but could not find relevant information. Up until today I have not been provided with at least some details as to why and how my relationship was unsatisfactory with CHASE.  ...  Credit card/Prepaid card\n",

              "      <td>I am writing to request an intervention into a denial by Chase Manhattan Bank to refund {$2100.00}, in fraudulent checks that were presented and cashed by the bank on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, my office received a telephone call from XXXX XXXX ( XXXX, Tel XXXX ) stating that he noticed a few potentially fraudulent checks. I immediately contacted him and informed him that the checks that he identified ( Check # s listed below ) were not written by anyone from our company, nor signed by me ( the only signer ) and therefore, the checks were in fact fraudulent. \\nI was at a local branch, on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, at the time I received this call on XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately sat down with a branch officer to report these checks as fraud. XXXX XXXX, branch officer, immediately called their fraud unit and reported fourteen checks as fraud and was given a Claim # XXXX. \\nThe Chase Fraud Unit reviewed the case and made a decision to refund only the checks that were presented on XX/XX/XXXX, totaling {$970.00}. Those that were presented on XX/XX/XXXX, which totals {$2100.00}, were not refunded. I was not pleased with their decision, and as such, I requested a second, and then, a third review of the circumstances, but to no avail. \\nMy branch officer, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), also contacted the Fraud Unit and asked them to reconsider their decision, but again the results were the same, denial. Chase staff at the XXXX/XXXX branch have been phenomenal in trying to assist me with this matter. \\nThere were several glaring issues with the checks that should have alerted Chase to their fraudulent status : 1. Fraudulent Checks are not signed with my name and I am the only signer on the account 2. Fraudulent Checks that were presented were not in sequence with the checks that I was writing at the time 3. Fraudulent Checks do not have the same Chase logo or address 4. Fraudulent Checks have no line for any signature I attached copies of the fourteen fraudulent checks that were cashed : XXXX - {$190.00} XXXX - {$290.00} XXXX - {$190.00} XXXX - {$290.00} XXXX - {$190.00} - refunded XXXX - {$190.00} - refunded XXXX - {$190.00} - refunded XXXX - {$190.00} XXXX - {$290.00} XXXX - {$190.00} XXXX - {$290.00} XXXX - {$190.00} - refunded XXXX - {$190.00} - refunded XXXX - {$190.00} For comparison, in order to clearly differentiate our valid checks from the fraudulent checks, I have also attached a copy of 4 legal checks. ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ). These 4 valid checks written and signed by me and presented on the same dates of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Please note both the glaring differences in the check sequences, as well as the pertinent data. \\nIn summary, Chase refunded 5 checks that were presented on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX- $ XXXX- $  XXXX- $ XXXX- {$190.00} XXXX XXXX - {$190.00} ). The total refund was {$970.00}. The total denial is {$2100.00}. \\nChase contends that since there was fraud on my account over a year ago and I did not, thereafter, change my companys account number, that I was responsible for the loss. I asked for reconsideration, as I explained that changing my account number would result in a severe financial hardship. In that, my income is based on direct deposits from our insurance payers and this money would be delayed. This calculation is based on my experience with Chase 3 years ago, when I changed my account number due to fraudulent checks and my funds were delayed. Also, please note that the aforementioned account number change did not prevent another round of fraudulent checks one year later. \\nThe name of my company is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a company that I started in XX/XX/XXXX to provide XXXX XXXX XXXX to the minority community. We help over 300 persons per year with their XXXX XXXX, so that they can be functional citizens for themselves, their family, and the community at large. \\nOur income is nominal and we struggle to meet bi-weekly payroll for the community staff that we employ to serve our clients. Chases decision to deny {$2100.00} to a small company has caused a tremendous impact on our budget. I know that for Chase and other large companies, this amount is miniscule and is less that a drop in the bucket, but for us, it means less service, reducing some employees hours to compensate for the loss. \\nIn today 's volatile times, digital theft is on the rise and banks must be on guard to circumvent it when possible. In that light, if XXXX XXXX was able to recognize the fraud, and went overboard to contact us, then Chase should have recognized the fraudulent checks, as well. It goes without saying that Chase was negligent in performing the minimum amount of due diligence, before approving theses checks More importantly, they should be held accountable instead of my small company. \\nIn summary, after reading the above, I hope that you render a favorable judgment on the part of the company, and further, that you intervene to enjoin Chase to refund the companys money. I can be contacted via email at XXXX or ( XXXX ) XXXX. \\nThank you for your time, attention, and consideration of this very important matter.

              "13284  I am writing to request an intervention into a denial by Chase Manhattan Bank to refund {$2100.00}, in fraudulent checks that were presented and cashed by the bank on XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. \\nOn XX/XX/XXXX, my office received a telephone call from XXXX XXXX ( XXXX, Tel XXXX ) stating that he noticed a few potentially fraudulent checks. I immediately contacted him and informed him that the checks that he identified ( Check # s listed below ) were not written by anyone from our company, nor signed by me ( the only signer ) and therefore, the checks were in fact fraudulent. \\nI was at a local branch, on XXXX XXXX and XXXX XXXX, at the time I received this call on XX/XX/XXXX. I immediately sat down with a branch officer to report these checks as fraud. XXXX XXXX, branch officer, immediately called their fraud unit and reported fourteen checks as fraud and was given a Claim # XXXX. \\nThe Chase Fraud Unit reviewed the case and made a decision to refund only the checks that were presented on XX/XX/XXXX, totaling {$970.00}. Those that were presented on XX/XX/XXXX, which totals {$2100.00}, were not refunded. I was not pleased with their decision, and as such, I requested a second, and then, a third review of the circumstances, but to no avail. \\nMy branch officer, XXXX XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ), also contacted the Fraud Unit and asked them to reconsider their decision, but again the results were the same, denial. Chase staff at the XXXX/XXXX branch have been phenomenal in trying to assist me with this matter. \\nThere were several glaring issues with the checks that should have alerted Chase to their fraudulent status : 1. Fraudulent Checks are not signed with my name and I am the only signer on the account 2. Fraudulent Checks that were presented were not in sequence with the checks that I was writing at the time 3. Fraudulent Checks do not have the same Chase logo or address 4. Fraudulent Checks have no line for any signature I attached copies of the fourteen fraudulent checks that were cashed : XXXX - {$190.00} XXXX - {$290.00} XXXX - {$190.00} XXXX - {$290.00} XXXX - {$190.00} - refunded XXXX - {$190.00} - refunded XXXX - {$190.00} - refunded XXXX - {$190.00} XXXX - {$290.00} XXXX - {$190.00} XXXX - {$290.00} XXXX - {$190.00} - refunded XXXX - {$190.00} - refunded XXXX - {$190.00} For comparison, in order to clearly differentiate our valid checks from the fraudulent checks, I have also attached a copy of 4 legal checks. ( XXXX, XXXX, XXXX, XXXX ). These 4 valid checks written and signed by me and presented on the same dates of XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX. Please note both the glaring differences in the check sequences, as well as the pertinent data. \\nIn summary, Chase refunded 5 checks that were presented on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX- $ XXXX- $  XXXX- $ XXXX- {$190.00} XXXX XXXX - {$190.00} ). The total refund was {$970.00}. The total denial is {$2100.00}. \\nChase contends that since there was fraud on my account over a year ago and I did not, thereafter, change my companys account number, that I was responsible for the loss. I asked for reconsideration, as I explained that changing my account number would result in a severe financial hardship. In that, my income is based on direct deposits from our insurance payers and this money would be delayed. This calculation is based on my experience with Chase 3 years ago, when I changed my account number due to fraudulent checks and my funds were delayed. Also, please note that the aforementioned account number change did not prevent another round of fraudulent checks one year later. \\nThe name of my company is XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX, a company that I started in XX/XX/XXXX to provide XXXX XXXX XXXX to the minority community. We help over 300 persons per year with their XXXX XXXX, so that they can be functional citizens for themselves, their family, and the community at large. \\nOur income is nominal and we struggle to meet bi-weekly payroll for the community staff that we employ to serve our clients. Chases decision to deny {$2100.00} to a small company has caused a tremendous impact on our budget. I know that for Chase and other large companies, this amount is miniscule and is less that a drop in the bucket, but for us, it means less service, reducing some employees hours to compensate for the loss. \\nIn today 's volatile times, digital theft is on the rise and banks must be on guard to circumvent it when possible. In that light, if XXXX XXXX was able to recognize the fraud, and went overboard to contact us, then Chase should have recognized the fraudulent checks, as well. It goes without saying that Chase was negligent in performing the minimum amount of due diligence, before approving theses checks More importantly, they should be held accountable instead of my small company. \\nIn summary, after reading the above, I hope that you render a favorable judgment on the part of the company, and further, that you intervene to enjoin Chase to refund the companys money.

I paid off the statement balance after receiving a debt consolidation loan. \\n\\nI then received a letter on XX/XX/XXXX notifying me that my credit limit would be decreased from {$3200.00} to {$500.00} based on a \" credit review ''. \\n\\nI contacted the credit account on XX/XX/XXXX and they offered to do another credit review, resulting in a hard inquiry, to determine if the credit limit could be restored. Why are you offering to pull a credit report if you claimed to have already performed a credit review? Or are you punishing me with a lower credit limit because you won't be able to collect any more high interest payments now that the balance was paid in full? \\n\\nAlthough my credit utilization rates are high, they have not changed within the past 6 months to 1 year. If the \" credit review '' revealed that my credit utilization rates were not favorable, why wait until the balance is paid off to lower the credit limit? \\nMaking better financial decisions should not affect credit worthiness. \\n\\nI've been a loyal customer since XXXX and have made all of my payments on time. I was planning on still using the card to keep it active, now I'm debating closing it because of the poor customer service and business practices. Disgusted  ...     1\n",

I was never in XXXX and reported the charges to Chase on XXXX occasions. I also had them replace my card with a new one and new number. Chase has not done a thing to remove the charges and i have been tranfered from dept to dept.

This JPMorgan Chase card has an Interest Rate of XXXX % for years and I finally decided to call JPMorgan Chase to inquiry about getting the rate reduced. After being put on hold for about 2 minutes by the CSR ( XXXX ) on XX/XX/2018. The CSR informed me that the current rate is the best rate I can get. By my account, and the 3 National Credit Bureaus my credit is rated as Excellent, and therefore, I Do Not Believe JPMorgan Chase acts in Good Faith with the FTC CARD Act of 2009 in doing a Fair and Honest review of Card Holders accounts. By reading recently about XXXX actions \" related calculating the APR didn't properly reflect the full benefit should have received for good behavior, such as paying on time ''. XXXX is issuing refunds to customers whose APR should have been lowered. I strongly believe that JPMorgan Chase also is not doing a Fair and Honest review as required by the LAW.  ...     1\n",
